<p>
    Welcome, I am a League player ever since 2012 and I have taught a total of 6 students to start and progress in this game.
    This website is created so I can organize all the students I have taught because I am thinking of helping more people
    get into this game that isn't just my friends. This database is useful when I have too many students to remember and
    need to organize or search my students by name, id or roles.

<h2>
    About Me!
</h2>

<p>
    I have been playing since 2013, started off as a support main until I found my favorite champion, which you can probably
    guess that it is Kassadin based on the background image. After finding my "Main", I transitioned into a mid-lanner and
    a jungler. My highest rank is Plat 2 and I haven't seriously playing for a while now, focusing on fun instead of winning.
    I plan to go back to be more competitive so that in the future I can become a professional couch for new players.
