<p>
    Welcome, I am a League player ever since 2012 and I have taught a total of 6 students to start and progress in this game.
    This website is created so I can organize all the students I have taught because I am thinking of helping more people
    get into this game that isn't just my friends. This database is useful when I have too many students to remember and
    need to organize or search my students by name, id or roles.
